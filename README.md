# Portfolio Construction and Visualization

As part of my graduate research, I needed a way to quickly build and visualize portfolio performance in the context of stress events. To do so, I prepared some python modules, which allow for easy and flexible portfolio construction, optimization, and visualization. The jupyter notebook shows a quick demonstration of portfolio construction, visualization, and analysis. As a work in progress, there are lots of room for improvement and I will continue to add to this project (including an interactive component and additional performance metrics). 

### What I have so far:
The upper left plot shows the cumulative returns for portfolio(s) and the benchmark. The upper right plot is currently empty (possible visualizations are included below). The lower left plot shows drawdowns and the lower right depicts the signal-to-noise ratio.
