# Portfolio Construction and Visualization

As part of my graduate research, I needed to quickly build and visualize portfolio performance in the context of stress events. Portfolio.py allows for easy portfolio construction, optimization, and visualization. The jupyter notebook shows a quick demonstration of what I have worked on so far. As a work in progress, there are lots of room for improvement and I will continue to add to this project.

### To do:
1. Upper right plot is missing visualization. Possible options are explored in jupyter notebook. 
2. Add more useful portfolio metrics like tracking error, information ratio, etc.
